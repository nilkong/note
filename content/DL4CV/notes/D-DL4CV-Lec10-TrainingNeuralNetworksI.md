# Introduction

In this lecture and the next lecture, we'll fully introduce how to actually train a neural network from scratch in practice. This lecture covers

# Content
## Activation Function
> This section we discuss the pros and cons of different activation functions

- [[D-DL4CV-Lec10a-ActivationFunction]]

## Data Preprocessing
> This section discuss different ways in preprocessing input data

- [[D-DL4CV-Lec10b-DataPreprocessing]]

## Weight Initialization
> Bad weight initialization can cause hard optimization. This section introduces some evident way of initializing

- [[D-DL4CV-Lec10c-WeightInitialization]]

## Regularization
> Aside from L1 and L2 regularization, there are still other way of regularizing
> In training process, regularization add randomness to the training process while in testing process, we average out randomness
